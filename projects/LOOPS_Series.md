## LOOPS Series

A comprehensive **curation and production** project developed within NewPractice, pushing the boundaries of live streaming technology and event management. The LOOPS series represents a significant advancement in multi-platform content delivery, combining technical innovation with artistic curation to create accessible, high-quality live experiences.

**LOOPS Series** evolved from the StreamingKit developed at InK端Le, expanding its capabilities to handle complex multi-platform broadcasting, live sound management, and audience engagement across various digital platforms.

## Project Overview

With the emergence of the need to produce and curate the LOOPS series within NewPractice, we pushed the StreamingKit from InK端Le even further to create a comprehensive production system capable of:

- **Simultaneously streaming to different platforms**
- **Controlling live sound in front of house (FOH) format**
- **Screening events on 3, 50-inch monitors**
- **Managing wireless microphones**
- **Managing 3 Black Magic cameras live in broadcasting format**

The project required deep research, fast prototyping, execution of ideas, and pushing the boundaries while being creative with available tools.
