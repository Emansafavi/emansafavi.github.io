## Sound/Thesis

A comprehensive **modular sound synthesis workshop** developed as part of my role in the InKüLe project, designed to bring technologies and perspectives to artists while providing them with practical tools for their artistic practice. The workshop represents a bridge between traditional artistic disciplines and modern electronic music creation.

**Sound/Thesis** introduces participants to the world of modular sound synthesis using VCV Rack, a free and powerful virtual modular synthesizer, guiding them from basic concepts to creating complex sound textures and musical structures.

## Workshop Development

As part of my role in the InKüLe project, one duty is to think of ways to bring technologies and perspectives to artists and provide them with materials and tools they can use in their artistic practice. For this purpose, I developed the concept of a workshop which was held on **May 26th, 2025** at the NewPractice studio.

The workshop was designed to be accessible to both beginners and intermediate users, providing a hands-on introduction to modular synthesis while maintaining the artistic focus that defines the InKüLe project.

## Workshop Content

The **Sound/Thesis - Modular Sound Synthesis Workshop Using VCV Rack** covered essential aspects of modular synthesis:

**Core Concepts:**
- **Modular patching** fundamentals and signal flow
- **Sound synthesis** principles and techniques
- **VCV Rack** interface and module functionality
- **Recording and integration** with digital audio workstations

**Hands-On Learning:**
- **Basic setup** and signal routing
- **Creating sound textures** and musical structures
- **Subtractive synthesis** techniques
- **Integration with DAWs** (Ableton Live, Reaper, Bitwig)

**Advanced Topics:**
- **Complex patching** techniques
- **Generative music** creation
- **Sound design** for artistic applications
- **Performance and recording** strategies

---

## Technical Implementation

The workshop utilized **VCV Rack**, a free virtual modular synthesizer that provides access to professional-grade synthesis tools without the cost of physical hardware. The system enables:

**Modular Synthesis:**
- Virtual Eurorack-style modules
- Real-time sound generation and processing
- Complex signal routing and modulation
- Professional-quality audio output

**Integration Capabilities:**
- Connection to digital audio workstations
- Real-time recording and playback
- MIDI control and automation
- Audio file export and processing

**Future Evolution:**
The workshop can evolve to include **interconnectivity of different apps via OSC over a VPN** - even remotely from each other - for any sort of sonification within the modular synthesis medium.
