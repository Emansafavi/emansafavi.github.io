# Hybrid Rituals

**Performance / Interactive Installation**  
**UNI.T - Theater der UdK Berlin · February 8, 2025**

---

## About the Project

**Hybrid Rituals** was developed and performed as part of 'An Experimental Ecology', a transdisciplinary event at UNI.T Theater, celebrating 50 years of UdK Berlin. The piece explored the merging of physical and digital dimensions through a real-time performance involving motion tracking, projection mapping, and responsive sound environments.

Audience interaction was central — light, movement, and sound responded dynamically to proximity and touch, transforming the stage into a hybrid field of ritual gestures. The system architecture was based on custom-built interfaces and audiovisual systems developed by the InKüLe group.

## Performance Context

This work was part of a larger celebration of UdK Berlin's 50th anniversary, exploring the intersection of art, technology, and human interaction. The piece challenged traditional performance boundaries by creating a space where audience members became active participants in the ritualistic experience.
