## Personal (Sound) Space

An installation project developed for the **‚ÄúPerspective in Design‚Äù** module (Hyperspace) in the Design and Computation master's program at **TU Berlin** and **UdK Berlin**.

**Personal (Sound) Space** explores how sound can define and protect personal space in public environments, inviting participants to reconsider the boundaries of spatial perception through auditory cues.

This installation was an interactive, site-specific sound work, developed as the practical component of my artistic research on the relationship between brainwaves and the auditory space surrounding an individual. The project aimed to reflect on scientific studies concerning personal space, critiquing their reliance on measurements in *physical space*, while sound ‚Äî as a medium ‚Äî propagates beyond these physical boundaries. This means encroachment into one‚Äôs personal space can occur through sound, without the physical presence of others within the traditionally defined range.

I consider this project a demonstration of the value of **interdisciplinary research**, engaging fields like psychology, neuroscience, sound studies, architecture, urban design, and sound art to investigate spatial perception through auditory experience.
