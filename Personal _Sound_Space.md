An installation project developed for the “Perspective in Design” module (Hyperspace)
          in the Design and Computation master's program at TU Berlin and UdK Berlin.
          “Personal (Sound) Space” explores how sound can define and protect personal space
          in a public environment, inviting participants to reconsider the boundaries of 
          spatial perception through auditory cues.

          This installation was a provoking sound interactive and site specific work which I developed as the practical part for the artistic research I did on the relation between the brainwaves and the auditory space around one individual. 
          Personal (sound) Space was meant to showcase and reflect on the scientific studies that has been done on personal space and criticize that the results of the papers are measurements in "physical space" hence the sound can propagate through the space and the encrouchment by sound into one's personal space can happen without the subject being in the physical range of the "Personal Space" reported by the studies. 

          I see this project as an example of the importance of interdisciplinary research and studying while the mentioned complexity can be a matter of psychology, neuroscience, sound studies and even architecture and urban design while it requires expertise in audio design and even art to investigate into the topic.
