An installation project developed for the “Perspective in Design” module (Hyperspace)
          in the Design and Computation master's program at TU Berlin and UdK Berlin.
          “Personal (Sound) Space” explores how sound can define and protect personal space
          in a public environment, inviting participants to reconsider the boundaries of 
          spatial perception through auditory cues.
