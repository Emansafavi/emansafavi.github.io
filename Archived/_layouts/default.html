      <h1>Artistic Technics,<br/>Computation & Sound Design</h1>
      <p>
        I’m an interdisciplinary artist and engineer based in Berlin. 
        I combine my love for music, technology, and design to craft immersive experiences. 
        Drawing from my background in chemical engineering, I treat creative processes 
        like intricate systems—shaping both the sonic and the visual world. My main interest at the moment is 
        interdisciplinary problem solving and the intersection of art and technology.

          An installation project developed for the “Perspective in Design” module (Hyperspace)
          in the Design and Computation master's program at TU Berlin and UdK Berlin.
          “Personal (Sound) Space” explores how sound can define and protect personal space
          in a public environment, inviting participants to reconsider the boundaries of 
          spatial perception through auditory cues.
