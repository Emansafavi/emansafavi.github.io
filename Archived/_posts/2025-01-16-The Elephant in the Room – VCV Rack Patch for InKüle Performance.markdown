On **February 8th, 2025**, as part of UdK’s 50th anniversary celebrations, I’ll be performing with **InKüle** in a special 20-minute piece. My contribution is a **VCV Rack patch** called ***The Elephant in the Room*** – you can check it out on [Patchstorage](https://patchstorage.com/the-elephant-in-the-room/).


## About the Patch
This patch is meant to generate evolving ambient textures and chord swarms in the background. I’m using a **Korg NanoKontrol2** to manage live transitions via faders and knobs:

- **Mixer Channels**:  
  1. Drone sound  
  2. Chord swarm  
  3. Sequence pluck (with rotary knob control)  
  4. Drum part  
  5. Glitchy high-end texture  

- **Rotary Knobs**:  
  - Control the probability of Bernoulli gates, which can turn a pluck sequence into a single note.  
  - Introduce random modulation to delay for *churby glitchy* sounds.  
  - Provide a basic DJ filter for final shaping.

When you open the patch, it will immediately start producing sound as soon as you select the correct output device in **AUDIO 8**.

## Demonstration Video
Below is a **10-minute YouTube demo** showcasing how I use this patch for ambient/background music. Here, I explore different soundscapes created live with just a NanoKontrol2 and a few simple faders.

In this video, you’ll see the variety of sounds I can shape with minimal controls.
