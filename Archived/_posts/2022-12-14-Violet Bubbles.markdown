In **December 2022**, I found myself in a challenging space—life was intense, and the sounds I heard in my inner universe weren’t especially vivid or polished. Yet, as an artist, I decided to share what I was creating, even if it wasn’t “perfect.” After all, in a world full of polished YouTube performances, it’s easy to lose confidence. But I realized imperfection can be more honest and real, so here it is: my patch called ***Violet Bubbles***.

## The Patch: Violet Bubbles
I built this patch in **VCV Rack (free version)**. It’s structured around:
- A **quantized sequence** running through **two oscillators**  
- A **simple drum machine** with reflections that often appear before the actual sound, adding a surreal sense of motion  
- A live-played **bass part** on a MIDI controller  
- Delayed and modulated sounds layered in as the piece progresses  
- The concept of starting with bit-crushed noise and distortion, then revealing the main sounds, and finally returning to noise at the end

I called it *Violet Bubbles* because, in those moments, I pictured violet spheres floating around me; for a brief time, I felt like I was off the ground—my own little journey to the moon and back.

## A One-Take Performance
This recording was entirely spontaneous:
- I realized late in the process I should film it, so I just grabbed my phone and did a single take.  
- The **guitar and vocal part** you hear was mixed in during video editing, aiming to capture the raw creative momentum in the moment.  

It only took me a few hours to edit, and I hope the result communicates both the imperfections and the sincerity that drove me to share it. As I work through the flux of life, I’m learning that sometimes the most honest art emerges before we make it “perfect.” Enjoy exploring this patch—maybe it’ll spark a little journey of your own.
