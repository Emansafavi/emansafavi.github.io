## About

**Fractal Fade** is a faceless ambient music project by [Eman Safavi](https://emansafavi.com). It exists outside the traditional music momentum—favoring **generative systems**, **modular synthesis**, and **tape-style degradation** over structured composition.

Minor Fall, the debut EP, is a slow drift. Built mostly with self-generating patches recorded in real time and post-processed for nuance. It’s meant for headphones, late nights, deep work, and long walks.

## Vision

Fractal Fade is about minimal identity and maximal texture. No face, no stories. Just sound that evolves on its own. Current areas of experimentation include:

- Self-generating modular systems
- Tape saturation and decay
- Long-form ambient installations
- DSP tool design and algorithmic patching
