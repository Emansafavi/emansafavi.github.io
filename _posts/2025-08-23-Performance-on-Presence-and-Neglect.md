In **August 2025**, I collaborated with **Awa Jalali**, a dancer and performer, on a project titled **UN03**, presented at **dbstudio in Berlin**.  
Awa approached me to create the **soundscape** for her performance — a work reflecting on the feeling of *being unseen or neglected while being fully present*.  

The performance was part of her broader **artistic research**, touching on recent events and their emotional residue, while exploring how visibility, silence, and movement interact within shared space.

### Process

I started the soundscape with an **8-minute sound collage** built from **free samples of fighter jets and F-35 recordings** — not as literal war sounds, but as a texture of tension, distance, and suspended weight.  
The sound was meant to occupy the space like an invisible architecture — something you *feel* more than you can describe.

Following that came Awa’s **15-minute narration**, which she recorded and sent to me.  
My task was to explore **temporal shifts** within her voice — stretching, warping, and layering time in sound — while keeping her story partially intelligible.  
The goal was to allow meaning to flicker through abstraction, without losing the emotional thread of her words.

The main challenge was **balancing comprehensibility and atmosphere**.  
I wanted the narrative to remain present, even when the language itself began to dissolve into tone and breath.

### Reflections

The final composition lasted around **20 minutes**, forming an evolving sound field where narration and noise blurred into each other.  
It was not simply accompaniment — it was a **shared act of listening**, an invitation to experience presence together.  

Through *UN03*, I began to see **listening as a collective provocation** — a way to open spaces for speaking about **traumatic experiences**, even when words alone can’t reach them.  
In that sense, the performance was less about sound or movement and more about **making silence audible** — together.
