## The Concept  
Lately I’ve been feeling a desperate need for **my community** — a group that resonates with what I create and explore.  
During my search, one word kept appearing: *niche*.

I tried to observe my work from the outside and realised that the combination of **modular synthesis** and **real instruments** captures everything I love doing.  
This hybrid world of sound brings together all my interests: electronic music, guitar performance, music theory, mixing, video editing, photography, lighting, and live performance.

The piece **“Celestial Evidence”** is the **third** in this ongoing series of audiovisual modular performances. Each one pushes me to use the full range of my creative and technical skills.

## The Patch  
This particular patch is built around a **C# minor loop**, structured as **four sonic islands** within my Eurorack:

- A quantized sequence rich in probability  
- A tape-based recording of that same sequence, played backward  
- An FM operator acting as the bass foundation  
- A drum island built from kick, white noise, and tape delays to emulate a snare  

Because of **CPU limitations**, I couldn’t record the **electric guitar** directly through VCV Rack.  
Instead, I recorded it as a **DI track** in **Reaper**, then roughly mixed it with the **WAV output** from the live patch.  
The result is a layered, textured blend between the modular system and live guitar.

## Reflection  
Throughout the process, I went through a mix of highs and lows, both technically and emotionally.  
At one point, a thought surfaced — *“It’s the fault in our stars.”*  
That phrase stuck with me. It became a metaphor for how creative flow, luck, and struggle intertwine.  
It’s a **celestial evidence** we all explore, navigating through our own astral climates — if that makes sense!

## Watch the Performance  
Here’s the video for *Celestial Evidence*:

## Closing Thoughts  
This project reminded me that the act of creation is rarely linear. It’s a dialogue between precision and chance, between what we plan and what simply happens.  
Each patch feels like a small planet — its own weather system, its own gravity.  

Maybe that’s the point.  
To keep orbiting, keep experimenting, and keep following whatever celestial evidence we can find.
