## Exploring Generative Music with VCV Rack
Using **VCV Rack** to push the boundaries of generative music and algorithmic composition. You can access my latest patches and experiments on my [Patchstorage](https://patchstorage.com/author/eman-safavi/) profile.

### Key Features of My Patches

- **Generative Music**: Creating evolving soundscapes and patterns.
- **Algorithmic Composition**: Using algorithms to generate musical structures.
- **MIDI Mapping**: Custom mappings for various MIDI controllers.

### How to Use My Patches

1. **Download**: Get the patches from my [Patchstorage](https://patchstorage.com/author/eman-safavi/) profile.
2. **Load**: Open them in VCV Rack.
3. **Modify**: Adjust the MIDI mapping if you are not using the same exact MIDI controller as me (which you probably are not).

> **Note**: In case of any questions about the patches, let me know.

Feel free to experiment and modify the patches to suit your needs. Happy patching!
