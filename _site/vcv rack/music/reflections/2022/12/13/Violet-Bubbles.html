      <h2>Violet Bubbles – A December 2022 Snapshot</h2>
      <div>
        <p>In <strong>December 2022</strong>, I found myself in a challenging space—life was intense, and the sounds I heard in my inner universe weren’t especially vivid or polished. Yet, as an artist, I decided to share what I was creating, even if it wasn’t “perfect.” After all, in a world full of polished YouTube performances, it’s easy to lose confidence. But I realized imperfection can be more honest and real, so here it is: my patch called <strong><em>Violet Bubbles</em></strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-patch-violet-bubbles">The Patch: Violet Bubbles</h2>
<p>I built this patch in <strong>VCV Rack (free version)</strong>. It’s structured around:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>quantized sequence</strong> running through <strong>two oscillators</strong></li>
  <li>A <strong>simple drum machine</strong> with reflections that often appear before the actual sound, adding a surreal sense of motion</li>
  <li>A live-played <strong>bass part</strong> on a MIDI controller</li>
  <li>Delayed and modulated sounds layered in as the piece progresses</li>
  <li>The concept of starting with bit-crushed noise and distortion, then revealing the main sounds, and finally returning to noise at the end</li>
</ul>

<p>I called it <em>Violet Bubbles</em> because, in those moments, I pictured violet spheres floating around me; for a brief time, I felt like I was off the ground—my own little journey to the moon and back.</p>

<h2 id="a-one-take-performance">A One-Take Performance</h2>
<p>This recording was entirely spontaneous:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I realized late in the process I should film it, so I just grabbed my phone and did a single take.</li>
  <li>The <strong>guitar and vocal part</strong> you hear was mixed in during video editing, aiming to capture the raw creative momentum in the moment.</li>
</ul>

<p>It only took me a few hours to edit, and I hope the result communicates both the imperfections and the sincerity that drove me to share it. As I work through the flux of life, I’m learning that sometimes the most honest art emerges before we make it “perfect.” Enjoy exploring this patch—maybe it’ll spark a little journey of your own.</p>
