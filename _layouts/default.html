        <h1>Interdisciplinary<br/>Artist/Engineer</h1>
        <p>
          I’m an artist and  an engineer based in Berlin, exploring the space where music, technology, and design meet.
          With a background in chemical engineering, I approach creativity as a system—connecting sonic and visual elements into coherent,
          immersive experiences. My current focus lies in interdisciplinary problem-solving and bridging the worlds of art and technology. 
          With sound in general as my main medium, I explore generative and interactive systems as well as music production and experimental performances.
